Scared To Death Story Map

Purpose: This project will create a mapping project of the first 100 stories told on scared to death that take place within the North American continent. This map will be stylized to match the aesthetic of the scared to death and presented to Dan and Lynze for the Wet Hot Bad Magic Summer Camp 2025.
For timing and scope management, only up to 107 regular stories will be dipicted in the map along.

Methods:
A geojson file will be created to house the intial story records

Each entry in the data will include the following

Title
Location
Latitude & Longitude
Short Description of the story
Classification: Ghost, Demon, Cryptid, Alien, or unknown for all other paranormal encounters

the data will then be exported to a shapefile that can be opened in qGIS. Qgis will then project the shapefile onto a base map of the United States.

With this information a detailed map can be created that shows the expanse of the scared to death stories
